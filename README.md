## Overview

I was tasked with creating a multi language blog, allowing users to either choose to have the entire site in English or Hungarian.

Having looked into different options for implementing the blog, I decided to use Sanity.io as the CMS. I've been wanting to implement a CMS into a project for a while now and this seemed like the perfect opportunity. Sanity studio will be perfect for the client as it seems to be very user friendly and easy to use.

<br>

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

<br>

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
